## [M3D: A Multimodal, Multilingual and Multitask Dataset for Grounded Document-level Information Extraction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11159622)

### 1. Dataset Introduction
M3D is a multimodal multilingual multitask dataset, which has the following features: 
* (1) It contains paired document-level text and video to enrich multimodal information; 
* (2) It supports two widely-used languages, namely English and Chinese; 
* (3) It includes more multimodal IE tasks such as entity recognition, entity chain extraction, relation extraction and visual grounding. 
* (4) In addition, our dataset introduces an unexplored theme, i.e., biography, enriching the domains of multimodal IE resources.
