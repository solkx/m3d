Within the circles of these authors , each influenced the other in both literature and life . A skiing trip with Hemingway inspired an exhilarated Archibald MacLeish to write pages of prose on his new sport . After reading them , Hemingway remarked , Never write about anything you don ' t know all about . In the warmer climates of Spain , Hemingway and Dos Pasos shared their sense of adventure by running with the bulls the In an equally dramatic event , James Joyce recited his manuscript of Finnegan ' s Wake over white wine with the MacLeish ' s and Sylvia Beach . Other nights , Joy simply accompanied MacLeish ' s wife Ada on the piano . He used to come over and play Ada ' s piano and teach her these wonderful Irish songs . I mean , the Bound of the Yellow Ale and all of these great songs , and they ' d sing together having . But all of that was part of work too . It was a deepening of their ideas , a strengthening of their concepts about what they were doing . They got a better sense of who they were and what they were after by what some people might think of as socializing , but which was really a kind of collective groping for the way .
