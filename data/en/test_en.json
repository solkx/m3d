The wholesomeness of the picture was hard to believe , after all the headlines about Mickey ' s private life . He was still married to Elaine Mankin , but by 1958 the marriage was on the rocks . She just said it was impossible to live with him . He never had any money . He never paid the bills . People would come and take the furniture out while they were sitting there eating dinner while he and Elaine were still married . Mickey met another beauty contest winner Barbara Ann Thomason , they quickly became an item . And when Elaine found out , she filed for divorce . By the time the decree was final Barbara was five months pregnant . She and Mickey got married and not long after .

It wasn ' t until the 1950s that readers rediscovered his books and critics began to rank Fitzgerald among the most famous among the best writers of his generation . His books now sell hundreds of thousands of copies a year . I think Gatsby alone sells over 300 , 000 thousand copies a year . It ' s probably among the most popular if you go by sales of any American novel . Over the years Fitzgerald ' s reputation has continued to grow . Today , his place among America ' s literary legends is secure and he is widely admired by many modern writers . I ' ve been interested in Fitzgerald ever since I was a teenager and read his novel , The Great Gatsby . It taught me a lot and it fortified my own ambition to become a writer of fiction . It also taught me not to try to become a writer of fiction like Fitzgerald because he has a connection with the English language which I knew even then . I would not possess . In my mind he stands out because is not like Hemingway , Mailer some of that Bigfoot . Male authors that were his contemporaries . He ' s got a different sensibility . He ' s more interested in love and desire and domesticity domestic life and suffer women writers . He ' s an accessible male writer . As part of the continuing rehabilitation of F . Scott Fitzgerald ' s reputation , In 1996 , the country celebrated his 100th birthday commemorative stamp .",

Camarero , $ 200 , please . Will you ? Finished . Telling my fortune ? Of course . But it might take a little while since you say I will live so long . I have time . Financially secure and approaching her 40th birthday , Ava chose to make fewer films . Most , like the dramas On the Beach and 55 Days at Peking , were filmed far from America . The further Gardner was from Hollywood , the more confident she felt as an actress where playing Women of the World was what people wanted a cast to write and she enjoyed those roles . Women who ' d been around who understood what life was like . She relaxed more in the roles . You ' re a hustler . A fantastic cool hustler . Ava loved the Night of the Iguana , based on Tennessee Williams ' play and co - starring Richard Burton and Deborah Karr . Will Mr . Shannon be all right , do you think ? All right , honey , I don ' t know . Director John Huston shared Gardner ' s passion for the good life . And the Mexican beach location offered plenty of opportunities for fun . Would you like to water ski ? and I think they would sometimes have to go by small boat from one place to another and she would water ski over .",

You know haven ' t I heard of weren ' t you in that production of the wives of Henry VIII ? And they didn ' t even realize how silly they were being . It took years call her Jane . And I remember the first time when Sally and Anne started calling her Jane . I was very taken aback , it seemed absolutely absurd because Joyce she was Joyce somehow , every way she but she moved and her hair The idea that she would change into Jane , it seemed impossible . The name change coincided with another life - altering event in 1969 . Sir Richard Attenborough , the esteemed actor and film director , picked Jane from hundreds of hopefuls and cast her as a chorus girl in Oh What a Lovely War . It was a lucky break that would lead to love and marriage and there the fairy tale takes a turn . Jane Seymour was 17 when she appeared in her first major film Oh What a Lovely War . Hanging around the set was the director ' s son , Michael Attenborough .",

You have to realize what character you are in and put yourself back in that character . But , um I think it ' s going to help me a lot . Just , uh Looking at his films now you know and realizing what a good actor he really was because before I didn ' t realize it because I ' d never done a film to film until a couple years ago . Now I see . I guess I first knew Clark Gable back in 1958 . I ' d read a story about an Italian fisherman on Capri who had a little boy and It was Funny story , a touching story , except there was one thing wrong with it . We wanted to do it for Sophia . So it was simple , we changed the whole story around and a set of Italian fishermen . It was an Italian girl who saw a who sang in a nightclub and how to take care of a little boy who was her nephew . So we wrote the story and we gave it to Sophia . We figured after our big success we had no problem . But Sophia and Carlo Ponti , her husband , decided they didn ' t want to do it and my agent at the time represented Clark Gable .",

One plain , one cup , until late in the war when it became too difficult to find silver . By that time , he had 50 cups on his mantelpiece . The serial numbers themselves , strips of linen cut from the sides of his victims whenever possible , literally papered the walls of his trophy room . When Richthofen Watch Boelcke die and he saw it from the air . Right alongside of them . Saw the crash , saw the wing . The Son of Great Near . And at this point in time , he knew that all you had . The shock to the unit was probably a realization that if this could happen to him , Boelcke The Master . It could happen to me . At first bulk of it done normally . I followed him immediately . Later one of the wings broke away and he went rushing down . His skull was crushed on impact . He died instantly . It affected all of us very deeply as if a favorite brother had been taken from us .

He adopted Virginia , Ardis ' s three - year - old daughter from her first marriage and proudly insisted that they live off his weekly income of $ 150 despite the fact that his film star wife earned five times more than he did . In December 1941 , the United States declared war . And like thousands of young men , Bill ' s 20 - year - old brother Robert left to fight in the Pacific . Holden hungered to join him in battle and became the first married film star to enlist . But because of his Hollywood status , He was assigned to a public relations unit on a base in Texas . On November 17th , 1943 , Ardis gave birth to a son Peter Westfield . But only two months later , the couple ' s joy was overshadowed by tragedy . When Bill received the news that his brother had been shot down over the South Pacific Ocean Bob was the reasonable balanced one , the one who could bring things together . He was apparently a warm engaging person . I think it Absolutely bewildered Bill . The thought that they would never see him again . Holden was overcome with guilt .
